## The Era of Ratings 

Ever wonder why you kept watching that show that you weren't all that interested in? What truly causes a cult-like audience? In this repo we will analyze the following:

- Whether environmental ratings such as IMDB play a role on what you binge next
- If you as the audience is more likely to skip around between episodes if your ride or die character has a special storyline
- Prediction of the next big binge on Netflix
